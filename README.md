# Rocketseat NLW 2
**[Next-level week](https://nextlevelweek.com/) 2** was a course provided by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) in order to teach their students how to code using **react.js** with **node.js**. On this course, we've created **Proffy** to web (with responsive design) and mobile platforms. Proffy is a fictional service that allows teachers to offer lectures to students who are searching for online lessons.

This repo is automated with Github Actions workflow. On every push and PR, github-pages is auto deployed and updated. You'll only be able to see changes on web interface because we are not using other environment to run mobile and server. In other words, **currently you'll not be able to interact with this application as the same way you can in your localhost**. :cry:
