# Rocketseat NLW 2
**[Next-level week](https://nextlevelweek.com/) 2** was a course provided by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) in order to teach their students how to code using **react.js** with **node.js**. On this course, we've created **Proffy** to web (with responsive design) and mobile platforms. Proffy is a fictional service that allows teachers to offer lectures to students who are searching for online lessons.
